                    <p><em>[Intro]</em>
                        I thought I'd grow old with you
                        In another life, in another world, it could be
                        In this one, all that's left is for me to leave one day
                        And only see you in the sunset
                        If you see me alone and sad, don't talk to me
                        If you see me alone and sad, it's my fault
                        Life is a party that one day ends
                        And you were my unforgettable dance
                        And you were my unforgettable dance
                        Eh-eh, eh-eh
                        Eh-eh, eh-eh

                        <em>[Interlude: Jacobo Morales]</em>
                        While one is alive
                        One must love as much as possible

                        <em>[Chorus]</em>
                        I thought I'd grow old with you
                        In another life, in another world, it could be
                        In this one, all that's left is for me to leave one day
                        And look up at the sky to see if I see you fall
                        If you see me alone and sad, don't talk to me
                        If you see me alone and sad, it's my fault
                        Life is a party that one day ends
                        And you were my unforgettable dance

                        <em>[Refrain]</em>
                        No, I can't forget you
                        No, I can't erase you
                        You taught me how to love
                        You taught me how to dance
                        No, I can't forget you
                        No, I can't erase you
                        You taught me how to love
                        You taught me how to dance

                        <em>[Verse 1]</em>
                        Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, hey
                        Tell me, how can I forget you?
                        There's a new move I wanna show you
                        At night, I can't even sleep anymore
                        All I do is dream of you

                        <em>[Refrain]</em>
                        No, I can't forget you

                        You taught me how to love
                        You taught me how to dance

                        <em>[Verse 2]</em>
                        The way you kissed me, the way I made you feel
                        The way you looked at me, it turned me on
                        It feels so wrong not to have you close
                        The new girl's good, but she doesn't have your lips
                        My devil, my angel, my crazy girl
                        My devil, my angel, my crazy girl, hey
                        [Interlude]
                        This sounds amazing
                        Let's do it again
                        Like last night, like last night
                        Dum-dum, dum-dum, du-du-dum
                        Bring it, kid, bring it
                        There, there, there, let's go!

                        <em>[Refrain]</em>
                        No, I can't forget you
                        No, I can't erase you
                        You taught me how to love
                        You taught me how to dance

                        <em>[Verse 3]</em>
                        Oh, I can sleep with anyone
                        But I don't wanna wake up with just anyone
                        Only with you, with you
                        I only dance with you, no one else but you
                        A kiss to wherever you are, wherever you are, baby

                        <em>[Refrain]</em>
                        No, I can't forget you
                        No, I can't erase you
                        You taught me how to love
                        You taught me how to dance
                        <em>[Verse 4]</em>
                        And I've had many girlfriends
                        But none like you
                        I don't have my sun anymore, I live on the moon
                        If I think of you, I'd go for it in an instant
                        Eh-eh, my devil, my angel, my crazy girl
                        My devil, my angel, my crazy girl, eh-eh</p>
