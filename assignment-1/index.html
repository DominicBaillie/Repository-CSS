                    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                    <P>
                        The lyrics in the song that I find most compelling is when he uses phrases such as <blockquote>"me paso en la luna"</blockquote>
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        The exact meaing of this phrases is "I pass myself on the moon". But the contrast presented is, that withought his sun he's living in the cold distant world of the moon. The way he contrasts his lyrics utilizing these phrases is what makes his songs especially compelling. Through-ouut this song he underscores the contrasting elements to emphasize the feelings of loss and longing, and such is the reasing of why I picked Baile Involviadable.

                    <p> 
                        The song discusses both the sadness and pain of the person he loved the most leaving him, but rateher than expressing soley the regret and pain of being left, he also emphasizes the shortness of life and the importance to enjoy love while you can. He contrasts both the pain and the joy caused by being he expereinced in both being loved and losing the person whom he loved.
